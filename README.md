# Open in External Browser

This project contains a Visual Studio extension (2010-2013) which alters the behavior of
Ctrl+Click in the editor to launch an external web browser instead of using the default
in-process browser.

Forked to add support for file:/// URIs, as well as options to select how to open the URI.
